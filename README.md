bipolar_osc
===========

Code for computing the bipolar oscillations in core-collapse supernovae.

Before executing, do 'mkdir Lambda_files' in the same directory as the python code.  To execute just run 'python compute.py' in the terminal.

Output files for the function Log(10, Lambda) at each distance are stored in the 'Lambda_files' directory.
